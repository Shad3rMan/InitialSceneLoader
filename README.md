# InitialSceneLoader

Hi everyone!

Have you ever worked over a project, that works well only when started from initial scene?
And you have to switch to that scene each time you want to test your changes... urgh!

So, here's a solution!

Checking "Should load initial scene" makes Unity load specified scene when you hit "Play". Note: if current scene contains changes - you will be prompted to save, discard changes or, if you press "Cancel", play mode will be interrupted.

Checking "Should load previous scene" makes Unity load the scene you were working on before.
